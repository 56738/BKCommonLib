This is a library-plugin system, introducing a lot of utility classes

It also simplifies coding:
- PluginBase: allows quick registering and monitoring of plugins being enabled
- (Async)Task: allows quick task starting and dynamic in-code creation
- Utilities for virtually every needed task ahead, from mathematics to obtaining an entity by UUID
- Custom node-based configuration extension
- BlockLocation, BlockMap and BlockSet to safely use blocks in maps and sets
- ItemParser class to generate a parser from user and use it during item transactions
- Nanosecond StopWatch class for performance monitoring
- Operation class to handle entities, players, chunks and worlds the way you want it
